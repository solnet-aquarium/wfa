# Wellington Free Ambulance SASS files

The CSS was initially created in an Angular App using SASS, as I was too dumb to figure out how to get the simple SASS preprocessor working. Things have now changed.

Angular has now been removed. Font Awesome didn't come with the BS download, that's copied from the existing CSS so there are now clashes.

As long as you have SASS installed globally, run `sass --watch scss:css`
